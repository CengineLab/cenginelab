#================================ Features to add or modify  =========================================
** The navbars(i.e main-nav and sub-nav) must be sticky

1. Make sure after creating a course, you should be redirected to the courses page.
2. Both the course title and the Learn button should redirect the user to the course-details page.  [DONE]
3. On the course_details page and course_episodes page only a course admin should see buttons like:
    -- Add Episode boutton
    -- Edit button
    -- Add a step button
4. The course_card should be re-dimentioned to accomodate three courses on a row
5. Instead of a ( Join ) button, lets have a (Learn) button. i.e for free courses
    --  Anyone who clicks the (Learn) button should have that course reflecting on his dashboard
    --  We can also implement progress status (i.e what percentage of the course you have completed.)
6. For paid courses, lets have a (Register Course) button insted.
7. A delete button to delete a course Episode and a delete button to delete a step of an episode.
8. If you click on an episode, the drop-down list should be links that sends you straight to the episode
#===================================== Suggestions ===================================================
>> We should create a base structure for :
    * course details page
    * course episode page

>> We have to implement a functionality where we can identify a course admin and give certain previleges.

>> We can also implement React for the sub-navs so that we can minimize loading the whole page all the time.
    That's for pages like Course_details and Course_episodes

>> Implement a registeration page for people who want to be Course Admins or Course Tutors      [DONE]
    - If someone registers, we have to validate and see if he/she is qualified as a Tutor
    - If he/she is, then set a tutor field in the User model to True
    ** This has been implemented but opens in a new tab **

>> Implement a profile page
